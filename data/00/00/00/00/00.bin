1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,810
{\an8}洛基

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,640
{\pos(190.2,132)}前情提要

3
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:52,720
{\an8}洛基
第一季第五集

4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,390
{\an8}时间变异管理局
时时刻刻  永永远远

5
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,060
{\an8}罗克斯葡萄酒

6
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,740
-相信这个人可不是明智之举  -我能应付他
- Trusting this man is not a good idea. - I can handle him.

7
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,060
时管局删除过很多这种人  没有任何两个是一样的
The TVA has pruned a lotta these guys, and no two are alike.

8
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,150
你们都是时间异体
You're all Variants!

9
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,770
时间守护者没创造你们
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.

10
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,090
他们从时间线里绑架走了你们
They kidnapped you from the timeline.

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,570
你俩引起的关联事件
The nexus event the two of you caused,

12
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,270
不管是什么  都能摧毁这里
whatever that connection is, can bring this whole place down.

13
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,690
好吧  你想知道真相吗
Fine. You want the truth?

14
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,230
我是想保护你
I'm trying to protect you.

15
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,580
我们之间的友谊非常罕有
Friendship like ours is uncommon.

16
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,860
如果我去哪里都可以  你知道我会去哪吗
You know where I'd go if I could go anywhere?

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,650
去我真正的家乡
Wherever it is I'm really from.

18
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,000
在时管局来之前  我生活的地方
Yeah, wherever I had a life before the TVA came along.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,220
删除他
Prune him.

20
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,910
时间守护者夺走了你们的人生
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.

21
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,630
你们都是时间异体
You're Variants.

22
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,000
我们是一样的
We're the same.

23
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,550
无意识的机器人
Mindless androids.

24
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,470
那是谁创造了时管局
Then who created the TVA?

25
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,420
茜薇  有件事我得告诉你
Sylvie, I have to tell you something.

26
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,380
你要一五一十地告诉我
You're gonna tell me everything.

27
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,200
这是什么地方  我们这是在哪  你们是谁
What is this place? Where are we? Who are you?

28
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
这里是虚空  那是埃里奥斯
This is The Void. That's Alioth.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,600
我们对它来说就是午餐  快走
And we're his lunch. Come on!

30
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,780
给我你的时空器
Give me your TemPad.

31
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,770
时管局背后究竟是什么人
Who's really behind the TVA? 

32
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,660
我跟你一样一头雾水
I'm as in the dark as you are.

33
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,050
可怜的伦斯雷尔法官  你的整个现实都被摧毁了
Poor Judge Renslayer. Your whole reality's been destroyed.

34
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,610
告诉我  这次轮到你了是什么感觉
Tell me, how does it feel to be on the other side of it?

35
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,200
就是这里  对吧
This is it, isn't it?

36
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,540
你偷了我的人生之后就拖我来了这里
This is where you dragged me after you stole my life.

37
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,640
那在这里夺走你的生命再合适不过了
A fitting place, then, to take yours.

38
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,810
要是我告诉你洛基没死呢
And what if I said Loki wasn't dead?

39
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,340
目前还没
Not yet, anyway.

40
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,320
-你在撒谎  -也许吧
- I'd say you were lying. - Maybe.

41
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,990
又或者我们有相同的目的
Or maybe we want the same thing.

42
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,530
他怎么可能还活着
How is he still alive?

43
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,200
救下他
And how will saving him

44
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,850
又怎么能让我们接近时管局的真正控制者
get us closer to who's really behind the TVA?

45
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,090
说来话长
It's complicated.

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,370
-我是自愿告诉你这些的  -为什么
- I'm telling you this willingly. - Why?

47
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,280
因为我想知道管事的究竟是谁
Because I wanna know who's at the top of this.

48
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,910
我想知道谁对我撒谎了
I want to know who lied to me.

49
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,070
我们删掉分支现实时
When we prune a branched reality,

50
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,630
不可能清除其所有物质
it's impossible to destroy all of its matter.

51
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,700
所以我们把它转移到时间线上的一个地方
So we move it to a place on the timeline

52
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,650
让它不再继续生长
where it won't continue growing.

53
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,800
基本上  分支时间线不是被重置了
Basically, the branched timeline isn't reset.

54
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,750
-而是被转移了  -转移到哪里
- It's transferred. - To where?

55
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,840
时间尽头的虚空
A void at the end of time.

56
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,600
每个存在的实体都在同一处发生碰撞
Where every instance of existence collides at the same point

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,540
然后停止
and simply stops.

58
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,670
为什么
Why?

59
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,580
我不知道
I don't know.

60
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,470
教条说时间的尽头依然在被书写
The dogma states that the end of time is still being written,

61
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,820
时间守护者正将其转化成乌托邦
that the Time-Keepers are transforming it into utopia.

62
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,620
很好  非常可信
That's nice. Super believable.

63
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,350
不管真正的原因是什么
Whatever the real reason...

64
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,870
没有东西从那里回来过
nothing ever comes back from there.

65
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,610
如果你相信我  我可以帮你
I can help you if you trust me.

66
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,040
我们先喘口气吧
I suggest we take a quick breather,

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,680
让我提几千个问题
so I can ask several thousand questions.

68
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,300
不行  得继续走  不然会死
Can't. Gotta keep moving so we don't die.

69
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,600
这我支持  但你的计划是什么
I can get behind that, but what's your plan?

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,350
-不死  -明白  但除此之外呢
- Don't die. - Okay, understood. But beyond that?

71
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,060
-不死  -这不叫计划
- Don't die. - Don't die isn't a plan.

72
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,940
这是活着的一般性要求
It's a general demand of living.

73
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,520
如果你们是洛基  就应该随时有...
If you're Lokis, you should always have...

74
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,370
谁能给我解释下这到底是怎么回事
Will someone please explain to me what the hell is going on?

75
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,890
听着  过去几天非常非常非常艰辛
Look, it's been a very, very, very trying past few days.

76
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,720
还是几个月  我都不知道距纽约之战有多久了
Months? I don't even know how long it's been since New York.

77
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
我只知道我被删除了  醒来就在这里
All I know is, I got pruned and I woke up here,

78
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,230
我现在被自己的时间异体包围了  还有一只鳄鱼
and now I'm surrounded by Variants of myself, plus an alligator,

79
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,440
说出来都让我心碎
which I'm heart-broken to report

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,290
我竟然不觉得这很奇怪
I didn't even find all that strange.

81
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,040
现在我们为了躲避那鬼东西  不知道要逃到哪去
And now we're running from God knows what to God knows where.

82
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,660
而我该做的是设法回到时管局
When what I need to be doing is trying to find a way back to the TVA.

83
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,360
别嚎了  会把埃里奥斯招来的
Stop wailing or you will signal Alioth.

84
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,920
你是说天上那个怪物吗
You mean the monster in the sky?

85
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,770
谢谢
Thank you.

86
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,040
时管局把垃圾倾倒在这里
This is the place where the TVA dumps its rubbish,

87
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,780
他们删除的一切
everything they prune.

88
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,490
而埃里奥斯
And Alioth,

89
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,460
它的作用是让一切有来无回
he ensures none of it ever returns.

90
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,190
它是一场活的暴风雨  吞噬物质和能量
It's a living tempest that consumes matter and energy.

91
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,510
他们把一个完整的分支现实送到这里
They send entire branched realities here

92
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,060
瞬间就被吞噬了
that are devoured instant -

93
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,350
我们在鲨鱼缸里  埃里奥斯就是那条鲨鱼
We're in a shark tank. Alioth is the shark.

94
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,540
没有鳄鱼缸这种东西
Oh, there's no such thing as an alligator tank.

95
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,410
再说  这个比喻更好
Besides, it's a better metaphor.

96
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,990
他跟我们一样过于敏感了
He's overly sensitive like the rest of us.

97
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,050
等等
Hang on,

98
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,920
-你是说那玩意也是个洛基吗  -对
- you're telling me that thing's a Loki too? - Oh, yes.

99
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,610
好吧  我愿意接受  为什么有这么多洛基
Okay, fine. Willing to accept that. Why are there so many of you?

100
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,860
因为洛基总能活下来  这就是我们的特质
Because Lokis survive. That's just what we do.

101
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,120
-很好  那我们怎么逃出去  -我们不逃
- Great. So how do we escape? - We don't.

102
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,540
我们都是被时管局抓起来删除的  和你一样
All of us were arrested by the TVA and pruned, just like you.

103
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,640
和你现在一样
And just like what you're doing right now,

104
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,050
我们都曾干站着  制定行不通的糟糕计划
we all stood around making bad plans that went nowhere.

105
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,520
但要是我们能用上时空器
Yes. But if we could use a TemPad.

106
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,130
唯一能让我们轻易逃出去的东西吗  是啊
Oh, the one thing that could easily get us out of here, yes.

107
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,420
它们到处都是  对不对  朋友们
They're all over the place, right, guys?

108
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,460
好吧  那引发一起关联事件怎么样
Fine. What about causing a nexus event?

109
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,450
时管局不在乎这里发生了什么
The TVA doesn't care what happens here.

110
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,690
-但我们肯定能做些什么吧  -是的
- Surely there's something to do. - There is.

111
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,770
活下来  就这么简单  从来都是如此
Survive. That's all there is. All there ever was.

112
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,090
别说了  走吧
We're done talking. Let's go.

113
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,530
你想怎么做就怎么做吧
Just do what you want, I guess.

114
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,220
好吧  等等
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

115
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,320
你凭什么戴着角  你听一个小屁孩发号施令
Why do you wear the horns? You let a child command you.

116
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,230
你最好尊重这孩子
You'll do well to respect the boy.

117
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,680
-这里是他的王国  -好吧
- This is his kingdom. - Right.

118
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,970
你的关联事件是什么  陛下
What was your nexus event, Your Majesty?

119
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,960
我杀了托尔
I killed Thor.

120
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,040
话说  你为什么这么想回时管局
So, why did you want to return to the TVA so badly, anyway?

121
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,470
你把你的光荣使命留在那里了吗
You leave your glorious purpose there?

122
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,990
差不多吧
Something like that.

123
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,810
分钟小姐  我要你远程访问
Miss Minutes, I need you to remote access

124
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,450
档案中的一系列保密文件
a series of restricted files from the archives.

125
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,210
天啊  什么文件
Ooh, doggy! On what?

126
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,230
关于时间初始  时管局的建立
The beginning of time. The founding of the TVA.

127
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,900
-马上  -等等
- Right away. - Wait.

128
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,130
-那时间的尽头呢  -只是虚空
- What about the end of time? - It's just a void.

129
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,840
如果虚空不是尽头呢
What if The Void isn't the end?

130
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,870
如果那之外还有什么呢
What if there's something beyond it?

131
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,570
藏在天启的阴影中  使我能躲过时管局
Hiding in the shadow of apocalypses obscured me from the TVA

132
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,180
因为在那里我无法创建时间分支  对吧
because I couldn't create a diverging branch there, right?

133
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,070
那么  如果这一切依然在被书写
So if all of this is still being written,

134
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,630
不管发生什么  都只是一条新时间线
whatever happens is just a new timeline.

135
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,930
在那里不可能发起关联事件
It would be impossible to start a nexus event there.

136
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,760
-可以完全不被人发现  -就是这样
- You could be completely undetectable. - That's it.

137
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,550
他们只可能在那里
That's the only place they could be.

138
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,550
那我们怎么越过虚空
So how do we get past The Void?

139
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,360
不可能
It's impossible.

140
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,910
时空器找不到切入点  没有目的地
There's nothing for the TemPad to lock onto, no destination.

141
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,340
那我们自己穿过去
Then we go through it.

142
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,870
-那等于自杀  -那看来我就用不着你了
- That's suicide. - Then I guess my need for you has passed.

143
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,560
等等  虚空飞行器能用吗
Wait. What about The Void spacecraft?

144
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,640
对  那台原型机
Yes, the prototype.

145
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,770
好  我去找文件
Great. I'll get the file.

146
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,320
那是一艘为承受时间虚空而设计的飞船
It's a spaceship designed to withstand the temporal void.

147
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,760
也许能带我们到时间尽头
It could conceivably take us to the end of time.

148
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,690
-找到洛基  -找到幕后的人
- Find Loki. - Find the man behind the curtain.

149
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,760
-杀掉他  -一起
- And kill him. - Together.

150
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,810
分钟小姐  关于这时间飞船的文件呢
Miss Minutes, where are the files on this timecraft?

151
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,760
还在找  亲爱的
Still lookin', hon.

152
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,560
没有结果吗
Nothing?

153
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
埋得可真深啊
Buried pretty deep.

154
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,770
是高度保密  我可能都没有权限
It's highly restricted. I might not even have clearance.

155
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,370
不  你肯定有  如果它真的存在
Oh, no, I think you would. If it's real.

156
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,430
还要多久
How long?

157
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,720
快了
Any second now.

158
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,790
快快快  上
Go! Go! Go! Move it!

159
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,860
-你受伤了吗  -我没事  但她拿走了我的时空器
- You hurt? - I'm fine, but she took my TemPad.

160
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,300
茜薇  你不是想逃走吧
Sylvie? Not thinking of going on the run, are you?

161
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,300
我们知道你藏在哪
We know where you hide.

162
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,180
我们迟早会抓住你
Sooner or later, we'll catch you.

163
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,340
你肯定身心俱疲吧
It must be so exhausting.

164
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,410
我承认  你有那么一下子真骗到我了
I'll admit you had me fooled there for a minute.

165
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,660
还是你说的是真心话
Or did you get a little real?

166
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,900
伦斯雷尔法官真觉得被她敬爱的时管局背叛了吗
Did Judge Renslayer really feel betrayed by her beloved TVA?

167
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,910
你出来吧  我们好好谈谈
Why don't you come back out and we can talk about it?

168
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,530
好啊  你让所有人都离开
Sure. Just tell everyone else to piss off

169
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,520
就我们俩解决
and we can settle this between us.

170
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,140
我觉得行
Works for me.

171
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,210
说好的"找到幕后的人"呢
What happened to finding the man behind the curtain?

172
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,170
不如这样吧  你高举双手出来
Tell you what. You come out with your hands up

173
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,930
我就把你关进时间循环
and I'll put you in a time loop.

174
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,900
选一段不太糟的
Something not so bad.

175
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,840
你就可以在美好回忆中度过余生
You can live out your days in a good memory.

176
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,140
你有美好回忆吗
Do you have any good memories?

177
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,540
只有一段
Just one, really.

178
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,740
-她删除了自己  -很好
- She self-pruned. - Good.

179
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,420
那她也死了
Then she's dead, too.

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
我击败了美国队长和钢铁侠之后
So, after I vanquished Captain America and Iron Man,

181
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,370
赢得了我的战利品  六枚无限宝石
I claimed my prize, all six Infinity Stones.

182
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,420
这是鳄鱼低吼着说"骗子"
That's alligator for growling and saying "Liar" at the same time.

183
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,860
至少我的关联事件不是吃了惹不起的邻居的猫
At least my nexus event wasn't eating the wrong neighbor's cat.

184
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,900
-给他们讲讲你的经历  洛基  -我吗
- Tell them your story, Loki. - Me?

185
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,060
没人想听
Nobody wants to hear about that.

186
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,510
其实我想听
I would, actually.

187
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,360
我在想  因为我...
It's just I've been wondering, because I'm...

188
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,960
我们本该死掉  不是吗
Well, we're supposed to die, right?

189
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,290
诸神黄昏之后  灭霸杀了我们
Thanos kills us after Ragnarok.

190
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,400
灭霸
Thanos?

191
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,350
在我的时间线里
In my timeline,

192
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,180
我这辈子一切都顺顺利利的
everything proceeded correctly, my entire life,

193
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,380
直到灭霸袭击了我们的飞船
until Thanos attacked our ship.

194
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,500
这么说你没试图用刀刺杀他吗
So, you didn't try to stab him?

195
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,760
当然没有
Certainly not.

196
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,680
别见怪  朋友们
Take no offense, my friends,

197
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,200
但在洛基的巫术面前  利刃不值一提
but blades are worthless in the face of a Loki sorcery.

198
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,860
它们妨碍了我们的魔法潜能
They stunt our magical potential.

199
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,740
-但利刃看着很帅  -是啊
- But they look awesome. - Oh, yes.

200
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,970
尤其是在你脖子被拧断之前
Especially when they clatter to the ground

201
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,760
刀哐啷一声落在地上时
just before your neck is snapped.

202
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,670
我造了一个自己的逼真幻影
I cast a projection of myself so real,

203
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,170
连那疯狂的泰坦人都信以为真
even the Mad Titan believed it.

204
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,070
然后我装作无生命的碎片藏了起来
Then hid as inanimate debris.

205
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,670
我假死之后  就在宇宙里漂流
After I faked my death, I simply drifted in space.

206
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,540
远离托尔  远离一切
Away from Thor, away from everything.

207
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,440
思考宇宙真谛和我在其中的位置
Thought about the universe and my place in it,

208
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,320
然后我发现  不管我去哪
and it occurred to me that everywhere I went,

209
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,400
都只会带来痛苦
only pain followed.

210
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,350
于是我将自己抽离出来
So I removed myself from the equation,

211
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,760
在一颗偏远的行星上落脚
landed on a remote planet

212
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,650
然后孤独地待在那里
and stayed there in isolation,

213
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,880
住了很久很久
in solitude for a long, long time.

214
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,280
时管局是怎么找到你的
How did the TVA find you?

215
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,420
我感到寂寞了
I got lonely.

216
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,000
说实话  我想我哥哥了
To tell you the truth, I missed my brother,

217
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,670
我想知道他和其他人有没有想我
and I wondered if he missed me, if anybody else did.

218
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,860
但我一离开那颗行星
But as soon as I took my first steps to getting off the planet,

219
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,560
时管局就到了
the TVA arrived.

220
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,480
因为我们只有一个角色要扮演
Because we, my friends, have but one part to play,

221
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,770
弃儿之神
the God of Outcasts.

222
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,770
仅此而已
Nothing more.

223
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,350
弃儿之神
The God of Outcasts.

224
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,320
-我要走了  -去哪
- I'm going. - Going where?

225
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,800
逃出这里  逃出虚空  回到时管局
Out of this place, out of The Void, back to the TVA.

226
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,360
我们虽然擅长活下去  但也擅长逃跑
We may be good at surviving, but we're also good at escaping.

227
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,940
反正也是个不错的机会
I wager that gives me a decent chance as any.

228
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,170
-哪样你都做不成  你会被残忍杀死  -随便吧
- You won't do either, you'll be brutally murdered. - Well, so be it.

229
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,050
-反正从一开始那就是我的命运  -你不一样
- That was my destiny to begin with. - You're different.

230
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,610
-为什么  -不  我没什么不同
- Why? - No, I'm not, you see?

231
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,950
我是一样的  跟你们所有人一样
I'm the same, really. I'm the same as all of you.

232
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,790
你们碰到过女性洛基时间异体吗
Have any of you met a woman Variant of us?

233
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,150
-听着好吓人  -她确实吓人
- Sounds terrifying. - Oh, she is.

234
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,040
但这也是她的伟大之处
But that's kind of what's great about her.

235
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,510
她才是与众不同
She's different.

236
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,060
她不是想夺下时管局
She's not trying to take over the TVA,

237
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,880
而是想扳倒它
she's trying to take it down.

238
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
她需要我
And she needs me.

239
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,860
你说埃里奥斯把我们困在这里
Now, you said Alioth is what keeps us here.

240
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,770
你说它是活物  你说它是鲨鱼
You said it's a living thing. You said it's a shark.

241
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,780
既然是活物  就会死
Well, if it lives, it dies.

242
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,680
所以我要灭了鲨鱼
So I'm gonna kill the shark.

243
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,640
我要杀掉埃里奥斯  我需要尽可能多的帮助
I'm gonna kill Alioth, and I could use all the help I can get.

244
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,570
太好了
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

245
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,520
-冷血怪物  -太好了
- Monsters. - Oh, yeah.

246
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,010
你好  你是我们中的哪一个
Hello, which one of us are you?

247
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,860
这真是一场噩梦
This is a nightmare.

248
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,470
是你
You.

249
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,310
关门  我们还没完全脱险
Can you shut the door, we still got a little bit of a situation here.

250
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,680
对了  你应该小心点
By the way, you should be careful 

251
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,460
别随便跳上陌生人的车
just jumping into a stranger's car like that.

252
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,310
-小心  -我看到了
- Watch out! - I see it, I see it.

253
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,490
是吗  因为你就冲着它开过去了
Really? Because you're driving right towards it.

254
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,600
天啊  你可真是个名副其实的洛基
God, you really are one of you.

255
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,910
坐稳了
Hang on.

256
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,590
你个混蛋  你引狼入室
You bastard! You led the wolves to our door.

257
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,930
跟狼相比  我们更喜欢被称为蛇
We prefer snakes to wolves.

258
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,930
我两种都吃过  它们同样会死
I've eaten both. They die just the same.

259
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,890
对不起  陛下
Apologies, my liege.

260
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,690
我背叛了你  现在我是王
I betrayed you, and now, I'm king.

261
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,280
关于这事
About that...

262
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,830
-你不是认真的吧  -拜托
- You can't be serious. - Come on.

263
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,300
-你以为呢  -我们说好的不是这样
- What did you expect? - That was not the bargain!

264
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,320
我供出我们的藏身处  以换取庇护所和供给
I gave you our location. In exchange for shelter and supplies,

265
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,650
你把军队给我  我登上王座
you give me your army and I take the throne.

266
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,130
对
Ah, yes.

267
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,860
这约定不太划算
Not so good a bargain.

268
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,210
这样如何  军队和王座都归我
How about this one? My army, my throne?

269
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,730
关于这事
About that.

270
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,900
你们这群愚钝  磕碜的卑鄙小人
Why you beef-witted, half-faced scrubs.

271
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,570
-我们说好了的  -老天
- We had a deal! - For God's sake.

272
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,890
这里怎么会有只鳄鱼
Why the hell is there an alligator in here?

273
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,490
他是个洛基
He's a Loki!

274
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,410
光荣使命
Glorious purpose!

275
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,240
来啊
Come on.

276
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,060
接招  洛基
Take that, Loki!

277
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,240
该死  一群禽兽
Damn it! Animals, animals!

278
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,860
我们撒谎  欺骗
We lie and we cheat,

279
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,060
我们割破每个信任我们的人的喉咙  为了什么
we cut the throat of every person who trusts us, and for what?

280
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,840
权力  荣耀的权力  光荣的使命
Power. Glorious power. Glorious purpose!

281
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,790
我们死性不改
We cannot change.

282
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,200
我们支离破碎  每一个都是  永远如此
We're broken, every version of us. Forever.

283
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,420
任何一个洛基一旦鼓起勇气改邪归正
And whenever one of us dares try to fix themselves,

284
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,110
都被送到这里等死
they're sent here to die.

285
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,360
所以我才需要离开这里
That's why I need to get out of here.

286
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,100
什么都无法改变  除非时管局被制止
Nothing can change until the TVA is stopped.

287
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,460
-你信任她吗  -她是我唯一信任的人
- And you trust her? - She's the only one I do trust.

288
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,980
现在
And right now,

289
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,790
我相信她是我们制止时管局唯一的机会
I believe she's our only chance of stopping the TVA.

290
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,350
我觉得这就够了
That's good enough for me.

291
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,470
好  我们帮你
Okay, okay. We'll help you.

292
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,120
但接近埃里奥斯
But approaching Alioth

293
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,910
等于自寻死路
is a death sentence.

294
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,580
我们会带你过去  但不会再多做什么了
We'll get you to it, but that's as far as we go.

295
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,750
一直以来  我真心相信我们才是好人
All that time, I really believed we were the good guys.

296
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,830
毁灭整个现实  让小女孩变成孤儿
Annihilating entire realities, orphaning little girls,

297
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,440
经典英雄作风
classic hero stuff.

298
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,290
当你认为只要目的正当  可以不择手段
Well, I guess when you think the ends justify the means,

299
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,910
你什么都做得出来
there's not much you won't do.

300
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,740
顺便说下  你也毁灭了不少东西
By the way, you did some annihilating too.

301
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,810
-我是迫不得已  -我也是
- I did what I had to do. - Yeah, so did I.

302
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,880
你把我当狗一样追杀
You hunted me like a dog.

303
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,860
我很抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

304
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,400
我删除自己时  以为也许能找到洛基
When I pruned myself, I thought I might be able to find Loki.

305
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,740
那团风暴  那玩意  很可能已经杀了他
That storm, that thing, it's likely already got him.

306
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,330
你真这么想吗
You really believe that?

307
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,630
我怎么想不重要
It doesn't matter.

308
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,150
现在唯一重要的是离开这里
The only thing that matters now is getting out of here

309
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,370
找出幕后黑手
and finding out who's behind all of this.

310
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,990
很好  我们怎么做
Great. How do we do that?

311
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,580
调头
We turn around.

312
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,680
调头  回愤怒云团那儿吗
Turn around? What, and go back to the angry cloud?

313
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,710
对  它可能就是答案
Yeah. I think it might be the answer.

314
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,120
我们必须回去
We're going back to it.

315
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,080
我必须说
I have to say,

316
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,540
走向那团巨物  感觉很怪
it feels odd walking toward the gargantuan creature.

317
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,380
你有行动计划吗
Do you have a plan of action?

318
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,330
进入它  找到它的心脏或大脑之类的
Get inside, find its heart or brain or whatever,

319
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,630
-然后...干掉它  -我觉得...
- and then, you know, do it in. - I mean...

320
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,240
虽然这计划不复杂  但不代表就不好
Ok, just because it's not complicated doesn't mean it's bad.

321
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,670
但也不代表是好计划
It also doesn't mean it's good.

322
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,990
瞧  他赞成
See? He's on board.

323
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,300
他是在祈祷  他认为我们死定了
He's praying. He thinks we're going to die.

324
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,130
全体船员到战斗岗位
All hands to battle stations!

325
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,760
埃里奥斯和其他动物一样
Alioth is like any animal.

326
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,210
它会先扑向大餐
He'll go after the big meal first.

327
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,550
趁它忙着猎捕时
And while he's busy with that,

328
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,250
我们可以偷溜到它后面  然后
we can sneak around the back and...

329
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,680
开炮
Fire!

330
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,210
好吧
Okay.

331
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,220
也许我们
Maybe we, uh...

332
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,840
再考虑周全些
think a bit more about this, huh?

333
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,400
有车
Car.

334
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,250
-什么  -沿着地平线开来
- What? - Along the horizon.

335
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,140
那是坏事吗
Is that bad?

336
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,890
通常是食人劫掠者
Well, usually means cannibalistic marauders

337
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,700
或食人海盗
or cannibalistic pirates.

338
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,570
真好
Delightful.

339
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,710
他们还减速了
Now they're slowing down.

340
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,310
-他们在干什么  -保持警惕
- What are they doing? - Just stay on guard.

341
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,840
茜薇
Sylvie.

342
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,140
我不明白  他这是懦夫还是勇敢
I don't understand. Is he a coward or was he being brave?

343
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,770
-我不太确定  -走吧
- I'm not too sure. - Come on.

344
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,190
你还活着
You're alive.

345
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,980
发生了什么  你没事吧
What happened? You okay?

346
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,170
莫比乌斯
Mobius!

347
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,310
-你们怎么...  -我们认为你需要增援
- How did you... - We thought you could do with some backup.

348
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,740
不  等等  他们是我的朋友
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, these are my friends.

349
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,460
他们是...怎么说比较好
Well, they're, um... How best to put this?

350
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,200
孩子时期的我们  未来的我们
Us as a child, us in the future,

351
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,420
和鳄鱼版的我们
and us as an alligator.

352
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,380
最好别去质疑
It's best not to question it.

353
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,940
随便扔块石头都能砸到个洛基
You throw a rock out here, you hit a Loki.

354
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,590
所以你们也在追捕巨云怪物
So you're all after the giant cloud monster, too, then?

355
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,390
我们还没决定怎么杀死它  但是...
Well, we haven't decided how we're going to kill it, but...

356
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,750
-你说什么  杀死它  -对  我们要杀了埃里奥斯
- Sorry. Come again? Kill it? - Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.

357
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,470
天啊  这就是你的计划
Oh, my God. That was your plan.

358
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,280
-是的  -你们都听他的
- Yeah. - And you all went along with it?

359
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,740
-我有过疑虑啦  -很可能不安全
- I was... I had my doubts. - Probably unsafe.

360
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,470
好吧  那你的计划是什么
All right, well, what's your plan, then?

361
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,240
我认为我们要找的人
I think the person we're after

362
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,330
就在时间尽头的虚空之外
is beyond The Void at the end of time.

363
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,540
如果真是这样
And if they are,

364
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,780
那怪物就是他们的看门狗  保护着唯一的入口
that thing is just their guard dog protecting the only way in.

365
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,370
好吧  那我们怎么越过看门狗
Okay, so, um, how do we get past the guard dog?

366
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,540
我要用魅术控制它
I'm gonna enchant it.

367
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,160
-那太疯狂了吧  -有多疯狂
- That's insane, right? - As insane as what?

368
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,090
-和把巨云当剪纸剪死一样疯狂吗  -听着
- Paper-cutting a giant cloud to death? - Listen,

369
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,090
-我来这里的时间比你久一点  -我要对它施魅术
- I've been down here a bit longer than you... - I'm going to enchant it.

370
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,870
她相当有自信
She's pretty confident.

371
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,190
下去吧
Leave us.

372
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,620
为什么把我关在这
Why am I locked in here?

373
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,950
你放走了那个时间异体
You freed the Variant.

374
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,890
-你背叛了时管局  -背叛
- You were disloyal to the TVA. - Disloyal?

375
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,410
-你以为你能逃脱惩罚吗  -背叛谁
- Did you think you'd escape punishment for that? - Disloyal to who?

376
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,680
你去过时间守护者的房间  他们不是真的
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers. They weren't real.

377
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,330
那又能改变什么
And why do you think that changes anything?

378
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,940
那改变了一切
That changes everything!

379
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,330
人们需要知道真相
The people need to know the truth.

380
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,140
不  时管局需要稳定
No, the TVA needs stability.

381
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,900
在我们弄清楚这是怎么回事之前
And until we can figure out what's going on,

382
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,230
必须维持稳定
that is what it will get.

383
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,410
所以你得把一切都告诉我
So you need to tell me everything.

384
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,160
你到底想要我怎么样
What exactly do you want from me?

385
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,200
你和那个时间异体连接过
You had a link with the Variant.

386
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,850
告诉我  是什么在驱使她
I want you to tell me what drives her.

387
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,850
复仇驱使着她
Revenge drives her.

388
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
杀死时间守护者
Killing the Time-Keepers.

389
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,730
但他们其实是假的  你可别忘了
But they turned out to be fake, in case you forgot.

390
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,230
所以她会寻找创造他们的人
So she'll be searching for whomever created them.

391
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,000
你根本不是为了保护时管局  对吧
This isn't about protecting the TVA at all, is it?

392
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,230
你也想找出在背后搞鬼的人
You just want to find whoever is behind all of this, too.

393
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,780
你永远也找不到的
You'll never find them.

394
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,000
不会比她早
Not before she does.

395
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,300
为什么
And why is that?

396
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,380
你只是想找到
You only want it.

397
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,320
而她必须找到
She needs it.

398
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,960
你好啊
Hey, y'all.

399
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,390
我要关于时管局建立的所有文件
I need all the files on the founding of the TVA.

400
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,130
从时间初始开始
Everything from the beginning of time.

401
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,170
这要求很难办
Well, that's a mighty tall order.

402
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,280
创建这地方的人有危险
Whoever created this place is in danger.

403
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,980
我得找到他们
I need to find them.

404
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,650
好吧  马上去办  女士
Okay. Right away, ma'am.

405
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,450
你真的不记得他了吗
You really don't remember him?

406
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,070
时管局逮捕了很多个洛基
I mean, the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis,

407
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,460
不过我不记得有只鳄鱼
but, no, I don't remember an alligator.

408
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,420
谁能断定他是洛基时间异体呢
I mean, who's to say he's even a Loki Variant?

409
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,340
他是绿色的
He is green, isn't he?

410
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,080
我说不好  他有可能在撒谎
I don't know, he could be lying.

411
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,190
放长线钓大鱼  当然了
The long con. Of course,

412
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,690
那他就更有可能是个洛基了
that just makes him more likely to be a Loki.

413
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,500
你们总是设下重重圈套  这我佩服
It's always the game within the game with you guys, which I respect.

414
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,900
莫比乌斯
Mobius,

415
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,820
假设你真回到了时管局
assuming you do get back to the TVA,

416
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,030
你会陷入什么麻烦
what exactly are you getting yourself into?

417
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,560
我不知道
I don't know.

418
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,110
我想让人们知道真相
I'd like to let people know the truth.

419
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,620
你就要这样背叛
So just like that, you're turning on 

420
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,790
你毕生致力于的事业吗
the very thing you devoted your life to.

421
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,290
改变永远为时不晚
Well, it's never too late to change.

422
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,770
但愿他们知道自己在干什么
I hope they know what they're doing.

423
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,510
莫比乌斯不算太坏
Mobius isn't so bad.

424
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,480
也不算很好
Or so good.

425
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,880
所以我们才处得来吧
I think that's why we get along.

426
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,820
他在乎你
He cares about you.

427
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,160
好冷
It's cold.

428
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,210
如果你想  我可以变一件给你
I could conjure one for you, if you like.

429
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,200
你可以帮我变套新衣服
Tell you what. You could conjure me a new outfit.

430
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,000
你不知道这种衣服有多不舒服
You have no idea how uncomfortable something like this is.

431
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,530
那么
So...

432
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,520
莫比乌斯和他的理论...
Mobius and his theory about...

433
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,290
对  关于我们的关联事件
Right, right. About our nexus event.

434
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,990
-根本是胡扯  -当然了  绝对是瞎说
- Total rubbish, right? - Absolutely. Of course. I mean...

435
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,280
我并不是说那一刻不美好
I don't mean that it wasn't a, you know, nice moment.

436
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,430
没错  那很棒  很美好
No, it was great. It was really nice. It was great. 

437
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,680
只是听起来又是时管局的谎言
It just sounds like another TVA lie.

438
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,720
百分之百  绝对的  嗯
A hundred percent. I mean, totally. Yeah.

439
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,940
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know how to do this.

440
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,530
我甚至不知道我们要做什么
I don't even know what we're doing.

441
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,480
我没有朋友
I don't have friends.

442
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,040
我没有...
I don't have...

443
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,150
同伴
anyone.

444
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,950
反正
Well...

445
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,940
有更重要的事  不是吗
you know, there are more important things, right?

446
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,300
对  像扳倒时管局
Right? Yeah. Like bringing down the TVA.

447
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,030
甚至是拯救宇宙
I mean, saving the universe, even.

448
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,740
没必要那么夸张  不过也算是吧
Well, there's no need to be dramatic, but, yeah, kind of.

449
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,780
不是很舒适
It's not very snuggly.

450
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,310
-好吧  -是桌布吗
- Okay. - Is it a tablecloth?

451
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,790
不  是张毯子
No, it's a blanket.

452
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,730
谢谢你
Thank you.

453
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,070
不客气
My pleasure.

454
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,070
我怎么知道在最后时刻你不会背叛我
How do I know that, in the final moments, you won't betray me?

455
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,260
听着  茜薇
Listen, Sylvie, I...

456
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,730
我背叛了所有爱过我的人
I betrayed everyone who ever loved me.

457
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,010
我背叛了我父亲  我哥哥
I betrayed my father, my brother...

458
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,270
我的家园
my home.

459
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,630
我知道我做过什么
I know what I did.

460
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,740
也知道我那么做的原因
And I know why I did it.

461
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,320
但现在的我不一样了
And that's not who I am anymore.

462
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,700
好吗
Okay?

463
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,180
我不会让你失望
I won't let you down.

464
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,350
你确定
You sure?

465
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,540
因为如果我们成功了  时管局消失了
'Cause if we make it, and the TVA is gone,

466
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,840
也许有条时间线供你统治
there might be a timeline for you to rule.

467
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,700
那我就终于能快乐了
And then I'd finally be happy.

468
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,410
你呢
What about you?

469
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,560
这一切结束后  你会做什么
What will you do when this is all over?

470
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,400
我不知道
I don't know.

471
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,130
我也不知道
I don't know either.

472
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,060
也许
Maybe...

473
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,410
也许我们可以想清楚
Maybe we could figure it out...

474
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,470
一起想清楚
together.

475
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,220
也许吧
Maybe.

476
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,520
好了  下一步怎么做
Okay, so what's the next move?

477
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,550
必须扳倒时管局
The TVA needs to be brought down.

478
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,870
我们不知道创建者是谁  也不知道他们在哪
We don't know who created it or where they are,

479
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,770
但那东西知道
but that thing out there does.

480
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,210
它之前袭击我时  我和它连接了
When it hit me earlier, I linked to it.

481
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,350
虽然很短暂  但我瞥见了一些画面
It was brief, but I caught a glimpse of something,

482
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,630
如果我能接近它  我就能用魅术控制它
and I think if I can get close enough to it, I can enchant it,

483
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,530
它会带我去找在背后操纵一切的人
and it's gonna take me to whoever's behind all of this.

484
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,850
我留下来
I'm staying.

485
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,160
-洛基  我不知道能否成功  -你去我就去
- Loki, I don't know if this is gonna work. - You go, I go.

486
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,070
马上就要出现了  时间分支会在那里
It's happening, guys. The branch will be right out there.

487
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,990
我会替你们问候伦斯雷尔
I'll give your regards to Renslayer.

488
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,200
拜托了
Oh, please do.

489
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,040
你们想要离开的票吗
You boys want a ticket out of here?

490
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,680
什么  不  我们不走
What? No. We're staying here.

491
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,730
这是我们的家
This is our home.

492
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,240
你们确定吗  埃里奥斯怎么办
Are you sure? What about Alioth?

493
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,840
我们已经撑了这么久  我们心里有数
We've survived this long. We know what we're doing.

494
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,010
洛基  你路上会用得到这个
Loki, you're gonna need this on your journey.

495
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,730
拿着
Go on.

496
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,510
祝好运
Good luck.

497
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,670
希望你找到你想要的
I hope you find what you're looking for.

498
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,420
看来你最后还是逃掉了
Looks like you got away in the end.

499
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,920
我总能逃脱
I always do.

500
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,100
你回到时管局后要做什么
What will you do at the TVA?

501
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,350
把那里烧成灰
Burn it to the ground.

502
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,910
谢谢你的火花
Thanks for the spark.

503
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,990
回头见  洛基
Well, see you later, Loki.

504
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,790
谢谢你  我的朋友
Thank you, my friend.

505
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,150
你是我最喜欢的
You're my favorite.

506
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,980
时间分支出现后  埃里奥斯会专注于它
When a branch appears, Alioth will focus on it.

507
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,140
那时我就对埃里奥斯施魅术
That's when I'll enchant it.

508
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,080
如果我们没时间等分支出现呢
What if we don't have time to wait for a branch?

509
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,100
那就得声东击西
We'll have to cause a distraction.

510
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,810
来抓我
Come and get me!

511
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,020
不  这边
No! This way!

512
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,880
来抓我啊
Come and get me!

513
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,870
他怎么做到的
How is he doing that?

514
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,490
我们比自己想的还要强大
I think we're stronger than we realize.

515
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,170
快
Go!

516
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,960
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

517
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,930
我们一起施魅术
We're gonna enchant it.

518
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,440
我不会
I don't know how.

519
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,830
你会
You do.

520
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,590
因为我们是一样的
Because we're the same!

521
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,640
光荣使命
Glorious purpose!

522
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,910
睁开眼睛
Open your eyes.
